## About Central Web

Central Web is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Central Web takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://Central Web.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://Central Web.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://Central Web.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://Central Web.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://Central Web.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://Central Web.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://Central Web.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://Central Web.com/docs/broadcasting).

Central Web is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
